# deep_learning_py
building deep learning algorithm and apply them on real-life problem-solving 

1. Neural networks code with l1 and l2 penalty build on numpy, and then tested on mnist dataset. The code was created on Jupyter notebook and the .py version was automatically translated by VScode: https://github.com/ramenwang/deep_learning_py/tree/master/vanilla_ann

2. The 'hello-world' of convolutional neural network - LeNet5, and the LeNet5 with certain improvement coded with tensorflow-gpu:
https://github.com/ramenwang/deep_learning_py/tree/master/LeNet5
The implementation is on mnist dataset which is provided by tf.keras

3. Other machine learning implementation based on numpy

    1. svm implementation with and without quadratic programming solver

    2. knn implementation with discussion regarding to different k values
    https://github.com/ramenwang/deep_learning_py/blob/master/lm_algorithms/knn.py
    
    3. lowess implementation
