# deep_learning_py
building deep learning algorithm and apply them on real-life problem-solving 

1. Neural networks code with l1 and l2 penalty build on numpy, and then tested on mnist dataset. The code was created on Jupyter notebook but has been automatically converted into py by VScode: https://github.com/ramenwang/deep_learning_py/blob/master/neural_networks.py

2. The 'hello-world' of convolutional neural network - LeNet5, and the LeNet5 with certain improvement coded with tensorflow-gpu:
